# Muninhall — user guide

[Русская версия](../ru/user-guide.md)

Muninhall is a Linux and Windows app to build, read and organize **your own library**. A library
is a folder on disk with books and articles (EPUB, FB2, MOBI, PDF); you can have several, and together
they can be browsed as one big library. **[LitRes](https://www.litres.ru)** is a pluggable commercial
library: purchased books and audiobooks are downloaded and opened in the built-in reader and audio
player. The look follows GNOME; light and dark themes follow the system. The interface is available
in Russian and English.

## Installation

### Ready-made installers

Each version on the [releases page](https://github.com/arvino-t/muninhall/releases) comes with:

- **`Muninhall-Setup-<version>.exe`** — an installer for Windows 10/11. Installs for the current user,
  without administrator rights; no Python needed. Shortcuts go to the Start menu (and optionally the
  desktop), EPUB/FB2/MOBI/PDF are added to "Open with". Uninstall via "Settings → Apps".
- **`Muninhall.flatpak`** — for any Linux with Flatpak: `flatpak install --user Muninhall.flatpak`.
  Data is shared with the native install (`~/.local/share/muninhall` etc.). Read aloud is not available
  in the Flatpak yet (no access to the system's speech-dispatcher).

### Linux from source (Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, Arch)

```
bash install.sh              # install or update
bash install.sh --uninstall  # remove
```

The app is installed for the current user. `sudo` is requested only if system libraries are
missing (Python 3.10+, venv, libraries for Qt and Chromium). The app lives in
`~/.local/opt/muninhall`, the command is `muninhall`, and "Muninhall" appears in the
app menu; EPUB, FB2 and MOBI files open with it.

### Windows from source

Double-click `install.cmd` (or run
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File windows\install.ps1`).

No administrator rights are needed. If Python 3.10+ is not found, the installer gets Python 3.12
via winget. The app lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Muninhall`, shortcuts go to the Start menu
and the desktop, and EPUB, FB2 and MOBI are added to "Open with" (default apps are not changed).
Uninstall via "Settings → Apps".

The first installation takes a while: PySide6 (Qt with the built-in Chromium) is about 600 MB.

### Moving from an earlier version

The app was called "Читалка ЛитРес" (LitRes Reader) before version 0.16 and Shelfwise in 0.16. The
installer removes the previous version (shortcut, icon, program), and Muninhall moves its data on
first start — the library, reading positions, settings, the LitRes sign-in and the backup folder; old
backups can be restored too. Close the previous version before the first start. The `litres-reader`
command keeps working.

## Libraries

The libraries added to the app are in Settings → Libraries.

- **Your own library** is a root folder on disk. Its subfolders become subfolders in the filter.
  Files open in place: the app doesn't copy, rename or delete them.
- **A library's data** (read marks, reading positions, graph state) is stored inside it, in the
  hidden `.library` folder. If the folder syncs to the cloud, the data moves to another computer
  together with the books.
- "Add library…" → "Your own library — a folder on disk…": choose a folder and give it a name.
  "Rename…" changes the name, "Remove" removes the library from the app (the folder and its
  `.library` stay). "Rescan" (or F5) looks through the folders again.
- On first start, three folders in Documents are added if they exist:

  | Folder | Library |
  |---|---|
  | `Documents/Books/others` | Other books |
  | `Documents/articles` | Articles |
  | `Documents/trainings` | Trainings and presentations |

- Each library has its own graph and its own backups; statistics are shared but can be viewed per
  library.

## LitRes

LitRes is connected as a library: Settings → Libraries → Add library… → LitRes. Without it, nothing
about LitRes appears in the app. "Disconnect" in the LitRes row hides its books, sign-in and sync;
downloaded files, marks and the sign-in are kept — you can connect it again.

**Signing in.** "Sign in" in the LitRes row (or menu → "Sign in to LitRes") opens the LitRes website —
sign in as usual: with a password, an SMS code or a social account. The app never sees or stores your
password; after you sign in it uses the session of its built-in browser. "Sign out" erases the
session; downloaded books and progress stay. The same row has "Books folder…" — where LitRes books
are downloaded.

After you sign in, the books from your account load automatically; while the window is open the list
also refreshes by itself (every 15 minutes by default), or press F5.

## The library view

Search by title and author with Ctrl+F.

**Filters** above the list:

- **Status** — All, Reading, Unread, Read. The numbers on the buttons count the books of the
  selected source and subfolder.
- **Source** — All (all libraries together), LitRes (with Books and Audiobooks under it) and each of
  your libraries by name.
- **Subfolder** — for LitRes, your LitRes folders (and No folder); for your own library, its folders
  on disk. Choosing a folder also shows the books in its subfolders.
- **Sort by** — recent, as on LitRes, title, author, series, progress, purchase date.

**Book card.** Click a cover — the book is downloaded (EPUB, otherwise FB2 or MOBI) and opened.
A long press or right click opens a menu: read or listen, mark as read, LitRes folders, download
again, open on the website, next in the series, show the file, remove from this device. The cover
shows progress, series and number; when you finish a book, the app offers the next one in the
series.

**LitRes folders:** book menu → "Folders…". Changes are sent to LitRes right away, or on the next
sync if you are offline.

**Download all books:** menu → "Download all books…" (or Settings → General). Choose books only or
books together with audiobooks. Books are downloaded one at a time with progress in the header;
stop with the same menu item. At the end you see a summary; books that failed and the reasons go to
the log.

## Reading

- **Turning pages:** tap the left or right third of the page, swipe, arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown,
  Space. Tapping the middle of the page hides and shows the bars for distraction-free reading
  (the chapter and percent stay in the page corners).
- **Bars:** at the top — Back, Contents, Text appearance, auto page turn, read aloud and full screen;
  at the bottom — a slider through the book. Clicking the slider jumps right to that place.
- **Text appearance** ("Aa" button): font size, theme (auto, light, sepia, dark, black), font, line
  spacing, margins, line width, two pages in landscape, justified text.
- **Gestures:** pinch or Ctrl+wheel changes the font size, swipe up opens the contents, swipe down
  hides or shows the bars.
- **Auto page turn:** turns the page every N seconds (5–120 s). Turning a page by hand restarts
  the countdown.
- **Read aloud:** reads from the current place, highlights the sentence and turns pages and chapters
  by itself. Uses the system voice (Linux — speech-dispatcher, Windows — SAPI). For a more natural
  Russian voice on Linux, install RHVoice (`sudo dnf install rhvoice speech-dispatcher-rhvoice`
  or similar).
- **PDF** opens right in the app; pages are shown as they are, without reflowing the text.
- F11 — full screen, Esc — leave full screen or go back.

## Highlights and notes

Select text in a book (EPUB, FB2, MOBI or PDF) and a bar appears above it:

- **four colors with a meaning**: yellow — "Important", green — "Advice", blue — "Concept",
  pink — "Question" (rename them in Settings → Integrations → Obsidian);
- **"Note"** — highlight and write down a thought, a question or how to apply it;
- **"Copy"** — the text to the clipboard.

Clicking a highlight opens its menu: another color, note, copy, delete. The "Highlights" button in the
reader's header lists all quotes of the book in order (color, chapter, note); a click jumps to the place.

Highlights of your own books are stored in their library's `.library/` and travel with the folder; those
of LitRes books are in the app data. Everything goes into backups.

## Focus

Your current reading priority: the topic you are developing now. Set it in the menu → "Focus…" or with
"◎ Set focus" under "Continue reading".

- **A focus** is a name and tags (genres, LitRes and wiki tags, topics, series, authors): books with them
  join the focus automatically. Add or remove a single book from its menu ("Add to focus", "Remove from
  focus"). Up to two focuses are active (a third archives the oldest); previous ones stay in the archive,
  and any of them can become current again.
- **The "◎ Focus" button under "Continue reading"** opens a panel with, per focus, progress (read, reading, total) and the next book: the started one first, then
  the most relevant by matching tags and closeness to the focus books you have already read; similar books
  outside the focus; "All focus books" leaves only them in the library. Focus books in "Continue reading" have a
  green border. Finish a focus book and the app suggests the next one.
- **So you don't get stuck in one topic**: once you have read "enough" (set in the focus window, 5 books
  by default, or 70% of the focus books), the app suggests consolidating it in the wiki and changing the
  focus, with candidates — large topics that do not overlap the current one.
- The focus is used by the **daily review** (quotes and passages from focus books first), the **graph**
  (focus books and tags are ringed, the analysis shows progress and adjacent topics) and **Obsidian**: the
  page `wiki/plans/Focus — <topic>.md` with tags, progress and books, which the local assistant uses for plans.

## Daily review

On the right of the library, under "Continue reading", there are two cards for the day:

- **My quote** — one of your highlights. Spaced repetition: "Remember" brings it back in 3, 8, 20… days,
  "Later" — tomorrow; advice and important quotes come first. "In the book" opens the book at the quote.
- **From a book** — a random complete paragraph from an EPUB or PDF book you are reading or have read.
  "Save quote" adds it to the book's highlights, "In the book" opens the book at that place.

The choice stays for the whole day and changes the next day; the review history is backed up.

## Audiobooks

Audiobooks have a headphones badge. The app downloads an M4B file or an MP3 archive and opens the
player.

- Chapters come from the markers inside the M4B (for MP3 — one file per chapter): a chapter list
  with start times, previous and next chapter; the slider and time are within the chapter.
- Skip back 15 and forward 30 seconds; speed from 0.75× to 2× without changing the voice pitch.
- Sleep timer: after N minutes or "At the end of the chapter".
- Going back to the library doesn't stop the sound; a button in the header returns to the player.
- Space — pause, arrow keys — seek.

## Continue reading and auto-resume

- **The Continue reading panel** on the right of the library shows the latest started books — read
  in the app or on your phone or the LitRes website.
- **On startup** the app opens the last text book at the place where you stopped — the most recent
  of the started and downloaded books, including reading on LitRes. Audiobooks don't start by
  themselves. Turn this off in the menu or in Settings → General.
- **Position from LitRes:** if you read or listened further on LitRes, the app jumps there by itself;
  the notification has an Undo button.
- A finished book is marked as read on LitRes too.

## Book graph

Menu → "Book graph" or Ctrl+G. The graph works like the one in Obsidian: books and tags are nodes,
and each book–tag link is an edge. Each library has its own graph: choose the library in the header
(the one selected in the Source filter by default); "All libraries" shows the combined graph. Graph
settings (tag kinds, filters) are remembered per library.

- Tags: wiki tags and pages of your Obsidian vault (topics, concepts, entities, comparisons,
  synthesis, projects — with the links between them), LitRes genres and tags, your LitRes folders,
  series, authors, topics of your own books and articles. All kinds are on; turn them off in the panel
  on the left, which also has search and an All / LitRes / Mine filter. Wiki links are taken the way
  Obsidian sees them (through its CLI when Obsidian runs), otherwise from the wiki files.
- **Possible tags** are dashed circles: words and word pairs shared by several books that are not tags
  yet, and pages the wiki mentions but nobody created. A click shows a hint; a second click on a
  possible tag adds it to those books' cards, a second click on a wiki page opens it in Obsidian. Toggle
  them with "Possible tags" in the panel.
- **Analysis** (at the bottom of the panel), for the current filters: topics and what is mastered (a
  read / reading / not started bar), where to look next (started but unfinished; large topics with
  nothing started), bridges between areas (tags that connect different groups of books) and what is
  missing (books without tags, top possible tags). A click on an item shows the node on the graph.
- Hovering highlights links, clicking a tag selects its books, clicking a book opens it. Wheel or
  pinch to zoom, drag to pan and to move nodes.
- Book colour: grey — not started, accent — reading, green — read.
- LitRes genres and tags load in the background after a sync (once per book). Layout and loading
  progress are shown at the top and under the window title.

## Reading statistics

Menu → "Reading statistics". Minutes today and this week, day streak, finished books, a two-week
chart and the books you spent the most time on. The selector on the left of the header shows one
library (all by default).

Reading on your phone or the LitRes website counts too: on sync, the progress gained is converted
into time (text — about 1300 characters per minute based on the book's length, audio — by duration)
and recorded for the day you read. That part of a bar is lighter on the chart. Change the reading
speed used for this estimate in Settings → Advanced.

## Settings

Menu → "Settings" or Ctrl+,. Changes apply immediately.

| Tab | What's there |
|---|---|
| **General** | interface language (system default, Русский, English — after restart); open the last book on startup; downloaded only; download all books (if LitRes is connected); statistics |
| **Libraries** | your libraries and LitRes — see [Libraries](#libraries) and [LitRes](#litres) |
| **Appearance** | interface theme (system, light, dark); accent color (system or the GNOME palette); app icon — nine to choose from, changes the window and app menu icon; keyboard shortcuts |
| **Reading** | text appearance, read aloud, auto page turn, audiobook speed |
| **Integrations** | Singularity |
| **Backups** | see [Backups](#backups) |
| **Advanced** | how often to refresh the library from LitRes and "Refresh now"; reading speed for estimating phone reading; verbose log; data, settings and cache folders; reset settings |

"Reset settings" returns text appearance, reading, refresh and log settings to defaults; folders,
the LitRes sign-in and the library are kept.

## Backups

Settings → Backups.

- **Library:** the selector at the top sets which library "Back up" and the backup list apply to.
- **What's in a backup:** an "All libraries" backup holds settings, statistics, Singularity settings
  and the data of every library; a single-library backup holds its marks, reading positions and
  graph. Books, covers and the LitRes sign-in are not included. The Singularity token goes into an
  "All libraries" backup only if "Include the Singularity token" is on.
- **When:** with the "Back up" button and automatically — an all-libraries backup daily or weekly
  (weekly by default). Old backups beyond the set number are deleted, counted per library.
- **Where:** `Documents/Backups/muninhall` by default; you can change the folder. If your
  Documents folder syncs to the cloud, the backups end up there too.
- **Restore:** from the list of recent backups or from a file (for example, from another computer).
  A single-library backup restores only that library. Before restoring, the current data is backed
  up separately, and the app restarts. The books and
  backup folders stay as they are on this computer.
- Backup files are accessible only to your user account.

## Singularity

Settings → Integrations → Singularity → "Set up…". Paste an API token from your
[SingularityApp account](https://me.singularity-app.com) ("API access", with access to tasks,
projects and habits) and choose what to sync:

- **"Reading" tasks** — started books become tasks in the "Книги" project; a finished book closes
  its task.
- **Progress in the task** — percent and current chapter in the task note.
- **"Want to read"** — unread books become tasks in a separate project; a started book moves to
  "Книги" as the same task.
- **Daily reading** — the "Чтение N минут" habit is checked automatically once you reach N minutes
  of reading or listening in a day.
- **Libraries** — whose books become tasks (all libraries by default; "Want to read" is LitRes-only).

Sync runs after the LitRes sync, when you mark a book as read and every couple of minutes while you
read. The app finds its own tasks by `externalId`, so there are no duplicates. Project and habit
names in Singularity are always in Russian, so switching the interface language doesn't create
duplicates. The token is stored only on this computer.

## Obsidian — a second brain

If you keep notes in Obsidian following the LLM Wiki layout (the vault has `CLAUDE.md` and a `wiki/`
folder, book cards are `wiki/sources/*.md` with a `file:` field), Muninhall works with it directly:

- **highlights** of each book go straight to `wiki/highlights/<Book>.md`: quotes by chapter, your notes,
  meaning tags (`#important`, `#advice`, `#concept`, `#question`) and an "in the book" link that opens
  Muninhall at that quote. The app rewrites only its own block of the page — your thoughts above or
  below it stay;
- **marking a book as read** sets `status: read` in its card, a started book gets `reading: true`;
- **tags**: "Tags…" in the book menu edits the card's tags (nested with "/", suggestions from the whole
  vault); the book graph shows them as "Wiki tags", with the parents of nested tags.

Choose the vault in Settings → Integrations → Obsidian (Documents by default). If the official Obsidian
CLI is enabled (Obsidian 1.12+: Settings → General → Command line interface) and Obsidian is running,
properties are changed through it; otherwise the app edits the Markdown files itself. Book files are
never changed.

## LitRes and VPN (Linux)

LitRes doesn't open through a foreign VPN. The scripts in `vpn-bypass/` send LitRes traffic directly
over the regular connection and everything else through the VPN. If `vpn-killswitch` is installed,
they add an exception for LitRes addresses only.

```
sudo bash vpn-bypass/install.sh           # install
sudo bash vpn-bypass/install.sh --remove  # remove (and restore the original kill switch)
```

## Where data is stored

| What | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Your library's data (marks, positions, highlights, graph) | `<library folder>/.library/` | `<library folder>\.library\` |
| LitRes books, covers, LitRes data | `~/.local/share/muninhall/` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\muninhall\` |
| LitRes session | `~/.local/share/muninhall/webengine/` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\muninhall\webengine\` |
| Settings, Singularity token | `~/.config/muninhall/` | `%APPDATA%\muninhall\` |
| Cache (service icons) | `~/.cache/muninhall/` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\muninhall\cache\` |

You can change the folder for LitRes books in Settings → Libraries. Data files are
created with owner-only access. Downloaded books and progress remain after uninstalling the app.

## Keyboard shortcuts

These are the defaults; change them in Settings → Appearance → Keyboard shortcuts (including one for
Reading statistics, which has none by default). Reader and player keys are not configurable.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| F5, Ctrl+R | refresh the library (LitRes and your folders) |
| Ctrl+F | search |
| Ctrl+O | open a file |
| Ctrl+G | book graph |
| Ctrl+, | settings |
| Alt+← | back |
| F11 | full screen |
| ←/→, PageUp/PageDown, Space | turn pages in the reader |
| Esc | leave full screen or go back |
| Space, ←/→ | pause and seek in the player |

## Limitations

- LitRes has no public API. The app uses the same endpoints as the website; if LitRes changes them,
  the book list or downloads will stop working.
- DRM-protected books and books available only for online reading on the website won't open.
- The exact reading position is not written back to LitRes — only the "read" mark.
- There is no automatic hyphenation: the built-in Chromium ships without hyphenation dictionaries.
- PDFs are shown page by page as they are; the font size of a PDF can't be changed.
